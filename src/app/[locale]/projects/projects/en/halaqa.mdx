## Overview

Halaqa (حلقة) is an open-source platform that helps teachers (الشيخ) manage their students and run weekly Quran memorization tests. It follows the نقزة (progress level) and جزء (juz) system, with a full history per student and a shared weekly dashboard. The interface is fully in Arabic and designed for mobile first.

The platform is free to use at [halaqa.abdeljawad.com](https://halaqa.abdeljawad.com/). It was developed by Abdeljawad Almiladi, based on an idea from Sheikh Abdulrahman Algharyani.

## What the Platform Offers

- **Teacher account**: Register and sign in with username or email.
- **Students**: Add students with a unique ID, name, date of birth, and profile photo.
- **Progress (نقزة)**: Each student has a current نقزة starting at 20, which decreases on success.
- **Tests during the حلقة**: Run random tests by:
  - Current نقزة (default)
  - Specific جزء when needed
  - Five أحزاب, quarter, half, or full Quran
  - No immediate repeat of the same ثمن; otherwise fully random.
- **Recording**: After each test, record ثمن tested, فتحة count, تردد count, pass/fail, numeric grade, verbal rating, date and time.
- **History**: Per-student history with optional time edits (within 30 days) and a time-range overview.
- **Reports**: Export to PDF and Excel.
- **Guest mode**: Test without signing in.

## Success and Grading Rules

- Up to 3 فتحة do not fail the student; the 4th is an automatic fail.
- تردد is tracked but does not cause failure.
- Grades: 60–100 on pass (based on فتحة and تردد); below 60 on fail.
- Ratings: ممتاز، جيد جدًا، جيد، مقبول، ضعيف.
- Weekly progress: Each success reduces نقزة by 1; a fail on Sunday keeps the student at the same نقزة for the next week.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite, with a single reference file for all 480 أثمان (سور، أحزاب، أجزاء، نقزات).
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL.
- **Auth**: JWT, password reset via email.
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions for build and deploy; manual deployment package available. Hosted at [halaqa.abdeljawad.com](https://halaqa.abdeljawad.com/).

## Outcome

Halaqa provides a focused, Arabic-first tool for Quran memorization circles, with structured testing, progress tracking, and exportable reports. The project is open source and welcomes contributions.
