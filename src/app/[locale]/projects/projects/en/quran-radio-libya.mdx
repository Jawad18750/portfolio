## Overview

I developed a mobile app and website for Holy Quran Radio – Tripoli, Libya (107.1 FM). The project enables listeners to stream the radio live on their phones and browse an organized archive of recitations on the web.

## Mobile App

The app provides live streaming of the radio broadcast. Features include:

- Live broadcast in high quality
- Simple interface with play/pause control
- Background playback (continues when the screen is off or when using other apps)
- Low data consumption
- Optional notifications for programs and events
- Links to the radio’s website and social channels

The app is available on Android and iOS.

## Website

The website at qrl.ly serves as both a live stream and an archive. It includes:

- **Audio archive:** Recitations organized by reciter, surah, juz, and recitation type. Search by reciter name or category.
- **Reciter pages:** Dedicated pages for reciters such as Sheikh Al-Amin Al-Nahum, Sheikh Al-Mabrouk Saleh Al-Maslati, and others, with their recitations listed by surah or juz.
- **Video content:** Video archive integrated with the radio’s YouTube channel.
- **Other sections:** About the radio, blog, contact page, and links to the mobile app and social media.

## Technical Notes

- The website uses a content management system so the radio team can add and update recitations.
- Hosting is provided by Libyan Spider.
