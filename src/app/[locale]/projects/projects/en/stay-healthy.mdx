## Overview

Development of the Stay Healthy platform, a leading destination in Libya for dietary supplements. The project is not just an online store—it is an integrated technical system that connects online sales with inventory management and accounting operations automatically.

## Technologies and Features

### Two-way Sync with Google Sheets

A two-way sync system was built between WooCommerce and Google Sheets, enabling real-time updates of prices, inventory, and orders. This simplifies management for non-technical users.

### Moamalat Payment Gateway

Integration with the local Libyan electronic payment system, allowing customers to purchase directly using local bank cards—an important step in advancing digital commerce in Libya.

### Cart Reminder System

A smart feature that sends automatic reminders to customers who did not complete their purchase, significantly contributing to improved conversion rates.

### UX Tailored for Athletes

A fast, easy-to-navigate interface with product filtering by goal (bulking, weight loss, energy) to simplify the customer journey.

### High-performance Hosting and Optimization

The site is configured to handle high visitor traffic while maintaining fast server response to ensure no sales are lost.

## Outcome

Stay Healthy delivers a complete e-commerce platform tailored for the Libyan market, with automated inventory sync, local payment support, and a streamlined experience for supplement and sports equipment buyers.
