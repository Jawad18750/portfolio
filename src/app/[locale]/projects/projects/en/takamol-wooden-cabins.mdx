## Overview

I developed a modern website for "Takamol", a leading Libyan company specializing in creating cabins, massive wooden buildings, and large pergolas. The company has a presence in both Benghazi (eastern Libya) and Tripoli (western Libya), offering services across the country.

This digital project reflects the company's craftsmanship identity and enhances its online presence to match its ambition in attracting both local and international clients.

## Technologies and Features

### Built with WordPress
WordPress was adopted as a content management system, giving the team full control to easily add and update content, including images, videos, texts, and new projects.

### Dynamic Portfolio System
Allows administrators to easily showcase the latest completed projects, including photos, specifications, and detailed descriptions.

### Professional Interface with Retina Support
Modern design supported by visual enhancements to maintain a premium user experience with CSS Animations.

### Fast and Performance-Optimized Website
The website was optimized for browsing speed and reduced loading time, enhancing visitor experience and improving the site's ranking in search engines.

### Multilingual Support
The website is available in three languages (Arabic, English, and French) to support the company's openness to international markets.

### Responsive Design
The website works perfectly on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

### Reliable Hosting via Libyan Spider
The website is hosted on Libyan Spider servers, where I work as an official authorized distributor of their services in Libya.

### Flexible Content Management
The Takamol team can modify every part of the website without needing advanced technical knowledge, including changing texts, images, and even the logo.

## Broader Collaboration Overview

This project is an extension of my previous relationship with "Takamol", where I was responsible for social media and digital marketing and developed the company's complete visual identity, including logo design and all visual elements.

## Outcome

The Takamol website reflects the company's commitment to quality and craftsmanship in wooden construction, enhancing its digital presence and making it easier for potential clients to explore their projects and communicate effectively.
